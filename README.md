### NOTES:

Set remote branch: git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>

### QUESTIONS
`Q1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.`

Notes: Simple if-else conditions with modulus operations.

`Q2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
find the sum of the even-valued terms.`

Notes: Iterative approach instead of recursion to avoid stackoverflow.

`Q3. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?`

Notes: Prime numbers need only be checked till the square root of the number.
